# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Personal Wellness Tracker 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that allows the user to keep track of various health related elements each day and see how he or she compares to the goals set. This data will be displayed for users to analyze. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software in this project will allow users to input various health aspects such as water consumption, sleep received, exercise done, and active mind time in a given day. After inputting the amount of time per each for that day, users will input their daily goals and the program will return if the goal was missed or met and by how much. The goal is to display this data through a visual representation such as a chart or graph. Another aspect to expand on would be creating a website for this application. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The program will provide health data for the user and allow for goal implementation.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The program will additionally display data visually for users via graph, etc.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If there is extra time to complete the project and time to develop an understanding of web development, it would be interesting to turn this project into a website.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Currently the program is written to collect user data, create goals, and return if users have met those goals. However, topics needed to research will be how to display this data through a visual or graph, as well as to possibly turn this software into a website. This would be a large step I would like to work towards if I can get the visual representation the data to display correctly in a timely manner. I am working by myself so this will be done by me.
